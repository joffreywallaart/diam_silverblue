In a silverblue installation, individual repo files can be copied to /etc/yum.repos.d.

This is also true for COPR repos.

After this, rpm-ostree can simply layer the packages from these repos. 

For instance: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/eduvpn/eduvpn-client/ has the links for the Fedora EduVPN repos.
